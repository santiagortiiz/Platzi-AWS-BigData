# Use cases
- Real time processing
- Big Data
- concurrency: up to 20.000 calls

# Integrations
- Kinesis data streams
- Kinesis Firehose (Data Input) and lambda for transformation
- DynamoDB
- Elastic Search
- RedShift
- Big Data ecosystem services

# Best practices
- One account by environment to avoid reach limits
- Use SQS to avoid throttles
- SNS if needed (real time)
- Optimize and automate the code deploy in lambdas
    Code Pipeline:
        Code Repository
        S3
        Lambda
    Cloud Formation

# Orchestation
- Step Functions

# Monitoring
- Include libraries such as "rollberg"?
- AWS XRay

# Error handling
- Stack overflow: dead queue -> processed by other lambda to ingest in dynamo -> Dynamo -> Re-ingest data
- Never lost events

# DEMO
- Create new function & set run environment
- Set triggers (SNS|SQS|others...)
- Script
- Environment variables
- Tags
- Role IAM
- Memory & time of execution
- Network
- Debugging and error handlers: DQL & XRay
- Concurrency
- Monitoring
